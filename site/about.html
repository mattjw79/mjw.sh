            I've spent the majority of my life working or playing with computers.
          </h1>
          <p>
            Some of my earliest memories are from the days of playing Hunt the Wumpus or Car Wars from a
            cartridge on the TI-99/4a in the early 1980s (yes, I'm that old). I'm pretty sure that little
            computer was where I wrote my first lines of Basic code. Granted, it didn't really do much
            other than draw a few straight lines or boxes but it was still code. I also remember writing
            fake viruses on the Commodore 64 not too long after that. Of course, that was inspired by my
            older brother showing me one that he'd written with his friends.

            The first IBM compatible PC that I'd ever used was the monstrosity that was a Spirit Eagle PC.
            Supposedly a "portable" PC it was 34 pounds and had a 9" green screen, a keyboard that would
            clip in to the case, and a handle for carrying attached to the back of the case. That machine
            taught me the value of "percussive maintenance". At some point in time, the 20mb hard
            drive wouldn't spin up when you turned it on unless you did a fist bump on the case right after
            flipping on the power switch.

            My father taught me most of what I'd learned on DOS, Windows 3.1 and later Windows 95. He didn't
            work in the field but he had setup a few systems for the university department that he worked
            for at the time. He even spent some time with me building and upgrading 386, 486 and 586
            systems. We also tried out a few brand new Cyrix chips that we're supposed to be "686"
            processors, there were more failures than successes with those.

            Everything I'd done with computers at this point was for fun and so that I could play the next
            exciting game that my parents brought home. The start to my career was a bit of luck.
            For an assignment in my computer applications class in high school (computer applications
            being MS Word and Excel) I needed shadow someone at their job and write about
            the experience in MS Word. I decided that since this was a computer applications class, it
            might be beneficial to shadow someone that works on computers for a living. So, the teacher
            got me in contact with the Technology Director, Joe, who worked for the public schools and
            I spent a couple days in the technology lab at the high school. At the end of the assignment
            Joe asked me if I would be interested in helping out on a volunteer basis after school. Thinking
            that it might be interesting and not having anything else to do after school I started volunteering.
            After a period of time (really not sure how much; weeks? months?), Joe dropped a timesheet
            in front of me and told me that I was hired if I wanted a part time job. It was mainly light
            troubleshooting and setting up new computers, but I liked the idea of getting paid for something
            that I was already doing for fun.

            I won't bore you with details about every job I've had up to this point so I'll give you the
            short version. I've worked at ISPs supporting dial-up modem service, did Windows phone support
            for a while, managed systems for a university and a college, worked my way up to being a
            systems administrator and later a datacenter architect. I moved through multiple jobs doing
            some level of systems administrator or systems design work. The past few positions that I've
            held have been DevOps style jobs with the aim of slowly moving me more toward systems development.

            Today, I'm a software engineer in the cloud infrastructure space designing and building
            automation for large scale applications. Most of my work the past year has been in
            Terraform, CircleCI, Github and AWS. Of course, I wouldn't be able to work with any of those
            effectively if I weren't also using scripting and programming languages like Bash and Javascript.
            My biggest asset is being able to translate from error messages, to Google, to code to fix
            the latest issue that's come up.

            I've learned a ton in the technology field and throughout my life in general and there are
            days where I'm not even sure if I've scratched the surface. Until retirement, I'm just going
            to keep doing my best and keep on learning.
